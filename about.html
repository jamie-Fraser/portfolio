		<p class="p-intro">I am a Visual Artist, Graphic Designer and most recently a Web Designer. I love all mediums of art and have a passion for creating. I'm 22 from Western Australia. My main platform of art is digital, although i do have alot of experience with traditional styles of art such as drawing and painting. I have recently started learning to design websites and have aquired a fair amount of knowledge and skills from it.</p>
